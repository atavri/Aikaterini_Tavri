  I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Brown University, with background in physical and satellite oceanography and specialization in radar remote sensing. My research focuses on the interactions between sea ice, waves, and the upper ocean, especially in the marginal ice zone (MIZ), where fragmented, drifting ice meets open water. This region is a hotspot of dynamic processes like wave-induced ice breakup and atmosphere–ocean heat and momentum exchange. These interactions are critical for sea ice evolution but remain poorly represented in most climate models. I am particularly interested in how sea ice breakup and melt influence the coupling between the ocean, atmosphere, and ice systems, and how satellite observations can reveal and quantify these complex interactions across scales.

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I specialize in microwave remote sensing of Arctic sea ice, focusing on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) analysis during the melt season. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Brown University.</p>

  <h2>Current Projects</h2>

  <h3>1. Antarctic SIC Bias Correction Using Multi-Sensor Data</h3>
  <p>
    As a co-investigator on a NASA-ROSES funded project, I study how ocean waves in the MIZ affect passive microwave sea ice concentration (SIC) retrievals in Antarctica. The goal of this project is to correct persistent biases in datasets widely used for climate model initialization and validation, such as the NSIDC Climate Data Record. For my contribution I am developing a framework that leverages multi-sensor satellite data (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ICESat-2) to detect wave-influenced sea ice conditions and quantify their impact on SIC over- and underestimations.

  <h3>2. Preparing for the NASA–ISRO SAR Mission (NISAR)</h3>
  <p>
    I participate as an Early Adopter of the NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission. I plan to combine L-band NISAR data with C-band Sentinel-1 to improve SIC retrievals in the Antarctic MIZ during the melt season, building on my earlier work showing the benefits of integrating both frequencies in this seasonal regime.

  <h3>3. Arctic Langmuir Turbulence from Coupled Wave–Ice Simulations</h3>
  <p>
    I work with coupled simulations using the NeXtSIM sea ice model and WaveWatch III wave model to assess wave-driven mixing and Langmuir turbulence in the Arctic Ocean. This modeling framework generates physically consistent wave-related parameters (Stokes drift, wave energy, and wind stress fields) under evolving sea ice conditions. Leveraging these outputs, we are conducting the first Arctic-wide assessment of Langmuir turbulence potential under realistic wave–ice interaction regimes. Upper ocean turbulence is essential to sea ice variability but such processes are often simplified or not included in Earth system models.

  <h2>Expeditions and Fieldwork</h2>
  <p>In 2020, I participated in the historic <strong>MOSAiC Expedition</strong>, conducting extensive in-situ measurements of sea ice and snowpack properties aboard the research icebreaker <em>Polarstern</em>. My work focused on integrating field data with microwave remote sensing observations to study Arctic summer sea ice processes.</p>
